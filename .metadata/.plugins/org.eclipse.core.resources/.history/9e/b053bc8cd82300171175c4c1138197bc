/*
 * 9. Palindrome Number
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 * hint:
 * Some hints: 
 * 
 * Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 * 
 * If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, 
 * note the restriction of using extra space.
 * 
 * You could also try reversing an integer. 
 * However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", 
 * you know that the reversed integer might overflow. 
 * How would you handle such case?
 * 
 * 
 * There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
