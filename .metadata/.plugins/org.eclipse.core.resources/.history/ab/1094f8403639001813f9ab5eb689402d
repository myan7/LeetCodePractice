/*
 * 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower 
 * 
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked. 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower. 
 * You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
 
*Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.
 *
